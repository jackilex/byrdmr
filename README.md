# About - Byrdmr

This project was build using bare React, it compose of a 
single page for a landing site

For this project I was given only the design. In a typical project I would have
communicate the design intent with the designers. In this scenario I had 
to make my own assumptions on how the design should look.

## assumptions
based on the folder provided there was a design called new that had 
one single page with multiple sections. the assumption base on the designed
is that each section should take 100vh of user
s screen
